  #  MacOS paths
  #  ===========
  #  MacOS directory separator is a colon ":" which is the only character not
  #  allowed in filenames.
  #
  #  A path containing no colon or which begins with a colon is a partial
  #  path.
  #  E.g. ":kalle:petter" ":kalle" "kalle"
  #
  #  All other paths are full (absolute) paths. E.g. "HD:kalle:" "HD:"
  #  When generating paths, one is safe if one ensures that all partial paths
  #  begin with a colon, and all full paths end with a colon.
  #  In full paths the first name (e g HD above) is the name of a mounted
  #  volume.
  #  These names are not unique, because, for instance, two diskettes with the
  #  same names could be inserted. This means that paths on MacOS are not
  #  waterproof. In case of equal names the first volume found will do.
  #  Two colons "::" are the relative path to the parent. Three is to the
  #  grandparent etc.
