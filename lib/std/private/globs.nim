unstable API, internal use only for now.
this can eventually be moved to std/os and `walkDirRec` can be implemented in terms of this
to avoid duplication

  #[
  note: a yieldFilter isn't needed because caller can filter at call site, without
  loss of generality, unlike `follow`.

  Future work:
  * need to document
  * add a `sort` option, which can be implemented efficiently only here, not at call site.
  * provide a way to do error reporting, which is tricky because iteration cannot be resumed
