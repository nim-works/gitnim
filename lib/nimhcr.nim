# This is the Nim hot code reloading run-time for the native targets.
#
# This minimal dynamic library is not subject to reloading when the
# `hotCodeReloading` build mode is enabled. It's responsible for providing
# a permanent memory location for all globals and procs within a program
# and orchestrating the reloading. For globals, this is easily achieved
# by storing them on the heap. For procs, we produce on the fly simple
# trampolines that can be dynamically overwritten to jump to a different
# target. In the host program, all globals and procs are first registered
# here with `hcrRegisterGlobal` and `hcrRegisterProc` and then the
# returned permanent locations are used in every reference to these symbols
# onwards.
#
# Detailed description:
#
# When code is compiled with the hotCodeReloading option for native targets
# a couple of things happen for all modules in a project:
# - the useNimRtl option is forced (including when building the HCR runtime too)
# - all modules of a target get built into separate shared libraries
#   - the smallest granularity of reloads is modules
#   - for each .c (or .cpp) in the corresponding nimcache folder of the project
#     a shared object is built with the name of the source file + DLL extension
#   - only the main module produces whatever the original project type intends
#     (again in nimcache) and is then copied to its original destination
#   - linking is done in parallel - just like compilation
# - function calls to functions from the same project go through function pointers:
#   - with a few exceptions - see the nonReloadable pragma
#   - the forward declarations of the original functions become function
#     pointers as static globals with the same names
#   - the original function definitions get suffixed with <name>_actual
#   - the function pointers get initialized with the address of the corresponding
#     function in the DatInit of their module through a call to either hcrRegisterProc
#     or hcrGetProc. When being registered, the <name>_actual address is passed to
#     hcrRegisterProc and a permanent location is returned and assigned to the pointer.
#     This way the implementation (<name>_actual) can change but the address for it
#     will be the same - this works by just updating a jump instruction (trampoline).
#     For functions from other modules hcrGetProc is used (after they are registered).
# - globals are initialized only once and their state is preserved
#   - including locals with the {.global.} pragma
#   - their definitions are changed into pointer definitions which are initialized
#     in the DatInit() of their module with calls to hcrRegisterGlobal (supplying the
#     size of the type that this HCR runtime should allocate) and a bool is returned
#     which when true triggers the initialization code for the global (only once).
#     Globals from other modules: a global pointer coupled with a hcrGetGlobal call.
#   - globals which have already been initialized cannot have their values changed
#     by changing their initialization - use a handler or some other mechanism
#   - new globals can be introduced when reloading
# - top-level code (global scope) is executed only once - at the first module load
# - the runtime knows every symbol's module owner (globals and procs)
# - both the RTL and HCR shared libraries need to be near the program for execution
#   - same folder, in the PATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH env var, etc (depending on OS)
# - the main module is responsible for initializing the HCR runtime
#   - the main module loads the RTL and HCR shared objects
#   - after that a call to hcrInit() is done in the main module which triggers
#     the loading of all modules the main one imports, and doing that for the
#     dependencies of each module recursively. Basically a DFS traversal.
#   - then initialization takes place with several passes over all modules:
#     - HcrInit - initializes the pointers for HCR procs such as hcrRegisterProc
#     - HcrCreateTypeInfos - creates globals which will be referenced in the next pass
#     - DatInit - usual dat init + register/get procs and get globals
#     - Init - it does the following multiplexed operations:
#       - register globals (if already registered - then just retrieve pointer)
#       - execute top level scope (only if loaded for the first time)
#   - when modules are loaded the originally built shared libraries get copied in
#     the same folder and the copies are loaded instead of the original files
#   - a module import tree is built in the runtime (and maintained when reloading)
# - hcrPerformCodeReload
#   - named `performCodeReload`, requires the hotcodereloading module
#   - explicitly called by the user - the current active callstack shouldn't contain
#     any functions which are defined in modules that will be reloaded (or crash!).
#     The reason is that old dynamic libraries get unloaded.
#     Example:
#       if A is the main module and it imports B, then only B is reloadable and only
#       if when calling hcrPerformCodeReload there is no function defined in B in the
#       current active callstack at the point of the call (it has to be done from A)
#   - for reloading to take place the user has to have rebuilt parts of the application
#     without changes affecting the main module in any way - it shouldn't be rebuilt.
#   - to determine what needs to be reloaded the runtime starts traversing the import
#     tree from the root and checks the timestamps of the loaded shared objects
#   - modules that are no longer referenced are unloaded and cleaned up properly
#   - symbols (procs/globals) that have been removed in the code are also cleaned up
#     - so changing the init of a global does nothing, but removing it, reloading,
#       and then re-introducing it with a new initializer works
#   - new modules can be imported, and imports can also be reodereded/removed
#   - hcrReloadNeeded() can be used to determine if any module needs reloading
#     - named `hasAnyModuleChanged`, requires the hotcodereloading module
# - code in the beforeCodeReload/afterCodeReload handlers is executed on each reload
#   - require the hotcodereloading module
#   - such handlers can be added and removed
#   - before each reload all "beforeCodeReload" handlers are executed and after
#     that all handlers (including "after") from the particular module are deleted
#   - the order of execution is the same as the order of top-level code execution.
#     Example: if A imports B which imports C, then all handlers in C will be executed
#     first (from top to bottom) followed by all from B and lastly all from A
#   - after the reload all "after" handlers are executed the same way as "before"
#   - the handlers for a reloaded module are always removed when reloading and then
#     registered when the top-level scope is executed (thanks to `executeOnReload`)
#
# TODO next:
#
# - implement the before/after handlers and hasModuleChanged for the javascript target
# - ARM support for the trampolines
# - investigate:
#   - soon the system module might be importing other modules - the init order...?
#     (revert https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pull/11971 when working on this)
#   - rethink the closure iterators
#     - ability to keep old versions of dynamic libraries alive
#       - because of async server code
#       - perhaps with refcounting of .dlls for unfinished closures
#   - linking with static libs
#     - all shared objects for each module will (probably) have to link to them
#       - state in static libs gets duplicated
#       - linking is slow and therefore iteration time suffers
#         - have just a single .dll for all .nim files and bulk reload?
#   - think about the compile/link/passc/passl/emit/injectStmt pragmas
#     - if a passc pragma is introduced (either written or dragged in by a new
#       import) the whole command line for compilation changes - for example:
#         winlean.nim: {.passc: "-DWIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN".}
#   - play with plugins/dlls/lfIndirect/lfDynamicLib/lfExportLib - shouldn't add an extra '*'
#   - everything thread-local related
# - tests
#   - add a new travis build matrix entry which builds everything with HCR enabled
#     - currently building with useNimRtl is problematic - lots of problems...
#     - how to supply the nimrtl/nimhcr shared objects to all test binaries...?
#     - think about building to C++ instead of only to C - added type safety
#   - run tests through valgrind and the sanitizers!
#
# TODO - nice to have cool stuff:
#
# - separate handling of global state for much faster reloading and manipulation
#   - imagine sliders in an IDE for tweaking variables
#   - perhaps using shared memory
# - multi-dll projects - how everything can be reloaded..?
#   - a single HCR instance shared across multiple .dlls
#   - instead of having to call hcrPerformCodeReload from a function in each dll
#     - which currently renders the main module of each dll not reloadable
# - ability to check with the current callstack if a reload is "legal"
#   - if it is in any function which is in a module about to be reloaded ==> error
# - pragma annotations for files - to be excluded from dll shenanigans
#   - for such file-global pragmas look at codeReordering or injectStmt
#   - how would the initialization order be kept? messy...
# - C code calling stable exportc interface of nim code (for bindings)
#   - generate proxy functions with the stable names
#     - in a non-reloadable part (the main binary) that call the function pointers
#     - parameter passing/forwarding - how? use the same trampoline jumping?
#     - extracting the dependencies for these stubs/proxies will be hard...
# - changing memory layout of types - detecting this..?
#   - implement with registerType() call to HCR runtime...?
#     - and checking if a previously registered type matches
#   - issue an error
#     - or let the user handle this by transferring the state properly
#       - perhaps in the before/afterCodeReload handlers
# - implement executeOnReload for global vars too - not just statements (and document!)
# - cleanup at shutdown - freeing all globals
# - fallback mechanism if the program crashes (the program should detect crashes
#   by itself using SEH/signals on Windows/Unix) - should be able to revert to
#   previous versions of the .dlls by calling some function from HCR
# - improve runtime performance - possibilities
#   - implement a way for multiple .nim files to be bundled into the same dll
#     and have all calls within that domain to use the "_actual" versions of
#     procs so there are no indirections (or the ability to just bundle everything
#     except for a few unreloadable modules into a single mega reloadable dll)
#   - try to load the .dlls at specific addresses of memory (close to each other)
#     allocated with execution flags - check this: https://github.com/fancycode/MemoryModule
#
# TODO - unimportant:
#
# - have a "bad call" trampoline that all no-longer-present functions are routed to call there
#     - so the user gets some error msg if he calls a dangling pointer instead of a crash
# - before/afterCodeReload and hasModuleChanged should be accessible only where appropriate
# - nim_program_result is inaccessible in HCR mode from external C code (see nimbase.h)
# - proper .json build file - but the format is different... multiple link commands...
# - avoid registering globals on each loop when using an iterator in global scope
#
# TODO - REPL:
# - proper way (as proposed by Zahary):
#   - parse the input code and put everything in global scope except for
#     statements with side effects only - those go in afterCodeReload blocks
# - my very hacky idea: just append to a closure iterator the new statements
#   followed by a yield statement. So far I can think of 2 problems:
#   - import and some other code cannot be written inside of a proc -
#     has to be parsed and extracted in the outer scope
#   - when new variables are created they are actually locals to the closure
#     so the struct for the closure state grows in memory, but it has already
#     been allocated when the closure was created with the previous smaller size.
#     That would lead to working with memory outside of the initially allocated
#     block. Perhaps something can be done about this - some way of re-allocating
#     the state and transferring the old...
